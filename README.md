## Description

My motivation for this challenge was to see how far my javascript knowledge has come  with the additions of third party api's.  As a class we have just recently learned about the many third party api's that exist within javascript, some of them being jQuery, bootstrap, and days.  With this new knowledge that was brought to my attention, not by choice i was curious as to how i can code with these third party api's, which is why within this challenge i decided to try and make it work mainly using the javascript portion of my program.  the reason i built this program was to have a clear and easy way to plan out my day, or someone else's if they decided to use it as well.  It helps keep me organised which I'm not very great at in the first place, so a code like this really benefits me and helps me stay on track with what needs to be done.  The problems my code solves is fixing my absolutely atrocious organisation methods, and making it so I stay on track.  The things I learned during this challenge was the full use of local storage and how to use it efficiently. I also learned how the backticks work fully now as well and how easy they can make my coding life.  Last thing i learned is that the linking portion can be really annoying, i know how that may sound but i did have to complete reset my whole code directory due to the fact that my files may have corrupted or something along those lines, to be honest i don't truly know what happened but as soon as i made a new directory it fixed.
